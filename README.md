# **GreatJob** - A Job Application Tracking App

_**GreatJob**_ is a full-stack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It's an application I built to help me keep track of the jobs I've applied for, and overall help me visualize the progress of my job search journey. Through the app, I'm able to add or update details about a job application (such as job title, company name, job listing URL, and submission date), delete an entry, and search/sort all the available entries to find a particular one I'm looking for.
